# Storyline
In a wealthy state like Connecticut, those earning slightly lower than the average median income can find themselves in a bind when looking for affordable housing options.  

There are simply not units at affordable prices available on the market. It's been like this for years, and such shortage is more pronounced in wealth towns, where the less-well-to-do earn more than people elsewhere, but still struggle with home burden.  

Inspired by CT Mirror and Pro Publica's series Separated by Design.

# Data and documents
I wrangled the affordable housing appeals lists published by Connecticut Dept. of Housing.
Income data from the 2014-2018 5-year ACS estimates published in Dec., 2019, downloaded from data.census.gov.

# Components
- Interactive Map with time series
- Interactive Scatterplot

# Tech specs
This is a working project exploring scrollytelling of CT Affordable Housing data with scrollama and d3. 
Other tools that were used:
- `pdf_tools`: an R package for wrangling pdf texts.
- `topojson`: a command line tool for converting GeoJSON to TopoJSON.

# Something I really want to add
Single housing zoning data or other zoning restrictions. This will speak directly to how zoning regualtions affect building of affordable units.
Problem is that there's no data in a parsable format and zoning data and regualtions usually differ by localities.
