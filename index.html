                        As the wealthiest state in the U.S., Connecticut doesn't offer a wide range of affordable
                        housing options.

                    Housing costs more, but people also have more money in their pocket to pay for them, right?
                    [[REWRITE]]For someone earning slightly less than the Average Median Income, it is often not the
                    case.
                    The percentage of monthly income spent on housing, renting or buying, is an indicator of housing
                    burden used by HUD.

                    <div class="title">Income and affordable housing avaialability</div>
                    An affordable housing unit is one that costs no more than 30% of the monthly
                    income of a family earning slightly less than the Average Median Income (80% of AMI). This is
                    achieved largely by public financing, in the form of government subsidies and credits, as well as
                    price or deed control in Connecticut.
                    Fewer than a fifth of Connecticut towns have more than 10% of housing units that are affordable.

                    In ..., where people earning three times the national average income, they are stuck with
                    trying their luck with limited supply of affordable housing, bite the bullet and pay for high rent
                    or mortgages, or relocate.

                    The rate hasnâ€™t improved. In fact, 99 towns have a smaller share of housing deemed
                    affordable from 2002 to 2018, the most recent year of available data. Local zoning regulations
                    plays a part.
